# STL Code Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of C++ code examples demonstrating the use of the Standard Template Library (STL). The STL provides powerful data structures and algorithms that can significantly enhance productivity and code efficiency.

## Contents

- **Containers**: Examples of various STL containers such as `vector`, `list`, `map`, and `set`.
- **Algorithms**: Demonstrations of STL algorithms like `sort`, `find`, and `copy`.
- **Iterators**: Usage of iterators to traverse and manipulate STL containers.
- **Functors and Lambda Expressions**: Examples showing the use of functors and lambda expressions with STL algorithms.
